 Okay.  I don't have my internet okayed for home here.  But that doesn't mean I can't still work on these projects just because the database is down!
 I can set up the frameworks the database will be displayed on for both Java and Obj-C.
 
 In XCode, I can expand the Storyboard to include the different table tabs, copying the code over and setting them with strict comments of what I've changed so that when I get back to internet I can test them individually to make sure they work like they're supposed to.
 
 For Java, I can draft an html file, see how to set up the date formatting (maybe I can get that to work in Objective-C too), and start a css file.  I can even try to write the html/css file with Bootstrap in mind.
 
 I can also go through more of the Bootstrap tutorial, or maybe even start the Javascript one.  Get a head start, you know?
 
 I'll reconvene with my thoughts at lunch and see where things go from there.
 
 Or maybe I can just ask Fabio to authenticate this wi-fi, although I'm not entirely certain that's possible.
 
 Break!
