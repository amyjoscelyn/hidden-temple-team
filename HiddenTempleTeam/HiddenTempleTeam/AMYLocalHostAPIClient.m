         maybe what I need to do here is like in Outside, where I use the responseObject to init a custom class object.  You know, set the properties here.  Maybe.
         
         So if I had a custom class for each table... I should be able to set the properties.  Of course, with my ability to make specific API calls, I can.  But also, I don't want to make to many calls.  So it would be best if I could just get the list of /all for each table, put them in a table, and then maybe when I go to the detail view, I can do a separate query for that id based on the row # selected.
         
         But I can't get a single entry until I can NSLog the dictionary outside of the block.
