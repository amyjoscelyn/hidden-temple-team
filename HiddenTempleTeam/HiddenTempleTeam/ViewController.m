     Okay.  So what I can do is simulate a menu.  Have a tab bar controller!!  Have a single tab for each table, and then simple buttons on each view for that table's queries.
     
     One for Players--player should be able to see player info (name, id#, birthdate, and the team they're currently on)
     
     One for Teams--when you see the team, you should be able to see the current players as well as the full history of hirees
     
     One for Games--you should be able to see a calendar of games, those that have been played and those upcoming.  Those that have been played should display score and winner.  All games should show the time and who is playing.  Time is something I don't have though, so I guess I can do even/odds--if it's an odd gameID, it'll be in the afternoon, even and it's in the evening.  I can choose like 2p and 6p or something for those games.  2 and 5, perhaps.
     
     Team Roster, being the join table, is a little tricky to differentiate from Teams.  The Team Roster contains the hiredate of all players to the teams.  Maybe I should display a Roster instead of the Teams page, unless Teams page contains information about them.  Ooh, that would be an interesting way to integrate a database with a csv-spreadsheet DB, by hooking up description codes on the server to descriptions from the CSV.  But anyway, I get ahead of myself.
     
     Team Roster, Game, and Players.  Team Roster can show team name, id#, history of players hired by date, as well as current players.
     
     They should be able to link to each other. You should be able to click on a person's name, and be brought to a playerInfo view, where you can see their info in depth.  I would need to segue to it, and have it be reloadable, so I'll set up a single pattern and stick with it for all of them.  Their info is uniform anyway. It should be able to show all players, including those unassigned.
     
     You should be able to see wins and losses for each team, as well as a leader board and maybe some stats--the team that's scored the most, the team that plays best home vs away, and maybe a bracket?
     
     I should be able to utilise the addPlayer, registerToTeam, and generate the next game and who's playing whom from SQL.
     
     What I really need to do is have my tab-bar open the three tabs to different views:
     Table view for Players
     Table view for Teams/Roster
     Calendar view for Games
     
     Not worrying about the Games yet, I can focus on Players and Teams.
     
     The opening view for both would be a dynamic table view, with the /all query populating each table row with a single player/team.  Then, when you tap on a row, it will take you to a detail view.
     
     Sounds great to me!
